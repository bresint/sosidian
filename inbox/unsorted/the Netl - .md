the Netlas API, which can be used to collect domain or IP address data, there are
hundreds of other different APIs that are useful for OSINT.
They can help you collect information about emails, phone numbers, physical addresses,
companies, cryptocurrency wallets, flights, and much more. You can find a list of them in the
APIs for OSINT repository on Github (https://github.com/cipher387/API-s-for-OSINT).
